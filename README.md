TweetDeck Chrome Trends
================

<http://www.willhawker.com/sandbox/add-a-trends-column-to-tweetdecks-chrome-extensionadd-on>

This is a very unofficial TweetDeck extension to add a Trends column

N.B. This is only compatible with the Google Chrome add on, and does not work for TweetDeck accessed via any other means.... Currently?

The now defunct Adobe Air version of TweetDeck, used to have a trends column, add I thought it be one of the most useful features of Twitter (except when it gets ruined by obsessive Justin Beiber et al fans). The new, web based version doesn't have this feature, and you can only add a search column for a specific trending topic.

This is a super unofficial, pretty dirty hack to add this functionality back in.

## Installation Instructions

Apologies, as its not the easiest thing in the world to install.

For all systems it essentially boils down to

1. Search for a folder called 'hbdpomandigafcibbmofojjchbcdagbl' 
2. Once found open it, and navigate into '1.5.3_0/web/scripts/'
3. Insert the contents of 'trends.js' **at the bottom** of 'default.js'
