TweetDeck Chrome Trends
================

For list of features see <http://www.willhawker.com/sandbox/add-a-trends-column-to-tweetdecks-chrome-extensionadd-on>

This is a very unofficial TweetDeck extension to add a Trends column

**N.B.** This is (currently??) only compatible with the **Google Chrome extension**, and does not work for TweetDeck accessed via any other means

The now defunct Adobe Air version of TweetDeck, used to have a trends column, add I thought it be one of the most useful features of Twitter (except when it gets ruined by obsessive Justin Beiber et al fans). The new, web based version doesn't have this feature, and you can only add a search column for a specific (worldwide) trending topic.

This is a super unofficial, pretty dirty hack to add this functionality back in.

## Features

1. Show trending topics for any region offered on the main Twitter site.
2. Show news/events relating to the trending topic
3. Shows most popular tweets for a search, rather than most recent
4. Filter trending topics using the built in Global Filter

## Installation Instructions

Apologies, as its not the easiest thing in the world to install.

For all systems it essentially boils down to

1. Search for a folder called `hbdpomandigafcibbmofojjchbcdagbl` 
2. Once found open it, and navigate into `2.1.0_0/web/scripts/`
3. Insert the contents of `trends.js` **at the bottom** of `default.js`
4. [Flush Chrome's cache](http://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95582)
5. Refresh the TweetDeck app page

## Limitations/Future work

1. Can only add one trends column
2. Will be wiped when TweetDeck is updated
3. Clicking on a trending topic only shows last ~10 tweets
